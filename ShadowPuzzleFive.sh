### DNBHL Automated Testing Script ###
# This is a script to automate checking codes for the DNBHL (Do Not Believe His Lies) application.

## To use, simply run the script and provide either a file path, or quoted guesses.  The script
## Automatically takes the strings (codes) and validates them.  If any matches are found, the
## Script will return "FOUND" and exit 0 - otherwise, the script will exit 1

## Example Usage:
# ./ShadowPuzzleFive.sh checkthisout.txt
# ./ShadowPuzzleFive.sh "the first time" "I SAW YOU THERE" "In my dreams"
